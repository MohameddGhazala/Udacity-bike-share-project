# Udacity-bike-share-project
Here is my solution for the first project in Udacity's data analysis professional program.
The goal of this project is to build an interactive experience with user and returning some statistical analysis to the dataset.
You can find more information about this dataset in the dataset.zip file.

I used python3 and pandas and numpy to do this analysis.
